System Guidelines

Use this file to provide the AI with rules and guidelines you want it to follow.
This template outlines a few examples of things you can add. You can add your own sections and format it to suit your needs

TIP: More context isn't always better. It can confuse the LLM. Try and add the most important rules you need

# General guidelines

Any general rules you want the AI to follow.
For example:

- Only use absolute positioning when necessary. Opt for responsive and well structured layouts that use flexbox and grid by default
- Refactor code as you go to keep code clean
- Keep file sizes small and put helper functions and components in their own files.
- Use react so include `import React from "react";` in every tsx file

# Design system guidelines

- Use a base font-size of 14px
- Never use the floating action button with the bottom toolbar
- Chips should always come in sets of 3 or more
- Don't use a dropdown if there are 2 or fewer options
